<div class="card">
    <h2>How do you calculate the value?</h2>
    <p>We use the excellent <a href="https://api-docs.npms.io/" target="_blank">npms.io API</a> to get a metric about
        how well
        maintained is the repository, its code quality and popularity. Then we sum all stars in the repositories you're
        using and multiply these by npms.io metric. Finally we calculate that for every 100 stars a maintainer spends 1
        hour per week on the project.</p>
    <p>For example: <strong>(number of starsÔ∏è x npms.io metric / 100) x price hour</strong></p>

    <h2>Why is this interesting?</h2>
    <p>Every day private companies are trusting more and more in Open Source projects that are not properly maintained
        due to a lack of financial support.</p>
    <p>Problems like <a href="http://left-pad.io/" target="_blank">left-pad</a>, <a
        href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/dk/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacker-infects-node-js-package-to-steal-from-bitcoin-wallets"
        target="_blank">event-stream</a>
        or <a

            target="_blank">1337qq-js</a> are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

    <h2>Is not sponsoring enough?</h2>
    <p>Sponsors are <a href="https://staltz.com/software-below-the-poverty-line.html" target="_blank">peanuts</a>.</p>
    <p>If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.</p>

    <h2>But Open Source projects can create Licenses to get paid</h2>
    <p>Licensing models work pretty well for big Open Source projects that are usually behind a company.</p>
    <p>There are thousands of small Open Source projects that are being used and nobody knows that they're using it.
        Still, the developers behind those libraries have to maintain a fragile ecosystem for free and private companies
        are in risk that those libraries stop being maintained, transferred ownership to potential hackers or worst.</p>

    <h2>What do you suggest?</h2>
    <p>I do not have a correct answer here. Maybe a royalty system might be a good idea, but the industry music royalty
        system has been a failure.</p>

    <h2>Are you suggesting that we all should pay for using Open Source projects?</h2>
    <p>NO.</p>
    <p>I think that companies obtaining an economically benefit by using heavily Open Source projects should compensate
        economically those projects.</p>

    <h2>Being paid is not against Open Source?</h2>
    <p>No. There are a lot of Open Source projects that have enterprise models to get a return.</p>

    <h2>Do you hate Open Source?</h2>
    <p>No. I love Open Source, I've created and contributed to Open Source projects for the last 13 years and I'll keep
        doing it.</p>

    <h2>It sounds like you hate it</h2>
    <p>No, really. I love it. <a
